Unfortunately, casual is usually an excuse for some people not to put effort in their dress and end up dressing terribly. I am sure you have observed it as well, everyone wears the same low effort style and calls it casual.

                The first outfit you should try involves shorts. Slim well fitting shorts. To nail this look, fit is very very important. The shorts should sit about an inch or two above the knee (avoid cargo shorts). A solid coloured tee shirt or polo will work well for this look as well as simple sneakers like vans or Chuck Taylors. Accessories will elevate this outfit.

                Outfit #4

                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Polo shirt and dress pants
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                This outfit is built with the polo shirt as its base. Polo shirts in simple colours are very versatile and are the dressier version of the tee shirt. The polo shirt can be matched with smart trousers, chino trousers or chino shorts. For your shoes, you should stick with dress shoes or simple sneakers.

                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The final outfit is what a lot of people will call business casual. It's the type of outfit you wear when your boss invites you for a sunday dinner. This outfit is a dressed down version of the suit. Remove your tie, let loose a few buttons and you're good. If you want, you can swap your Oxford shirt for a tee shirt and your dress shoes for a pair of sneakers to add a smart casual twist.
